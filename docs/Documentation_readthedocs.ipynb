    "# How to create documentation of project or website using Jupyter notebook, Github and Read the docs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Python\n",
    "2. Jupyter notebook\n",
    "3. Github account\n",
    "4. Github desktop\n",
    "5. Read the docs account\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional\n",
    "1. Visual studio code or any code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "### Sphinx (Based on this [page](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html))\n",
    "1. Assuming you have Python already, install [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) by typing the following command line in Command prompt:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "$ pip install sphinx\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a public repository in Github or use an existing repository in Github, either through Github Desktop or directly on Github. Make this repository available locally on your machine through Github Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a directory in the repository (aka. repo) with the name `docs`. (You can choose other name as well, but here we will use the name `docs`) locally on your machine. You can `push` it later to Github via Github Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Run `sphinx-quickstart` in the `docs` directory we have just created from the Command prompt by first changing the current directory to `docs`:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "$ cd docs\n",
    "$ sphinx-quickstart\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    ">This quick start will walk you through the basic configuration; in most cases, you can just accept the defaults (Default values or answers are given in square bracket. Just press enter to accept default answers). When it’s done, you’ll have an `index.rst`, a `conf.py` and some other files."

    "### nbsphinx (Based on this [page](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.0/installation.html))\n",
    "1. Install nbsphinx. See this [page](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.0/installation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a Jupyter notebook that you want to use as the documentation for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open the file named `conf.py` either using a code editor like Visual studio code (VSC) or just normal text editor, for example: notepad. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the `extensions` line and add `nbsphinx` and `sphinx.ext.mathjax` to the extensions:\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "extensions = [\n",
    "    'nbsphinx',\n",
    "    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',\n",
    "]\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open the file named `index.rst` (e.g. using VSC) and add the files' names of your notebooks (without the .ipynb extension) to the toctree (`toc` stands for \"table of contents\") directive. For example, if I have the notebooks `intro.ipynb` and `quantum_mechanics.ipynb`:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    ".. toctree::\n",
    "   :maxdepth: 2\n",
    "   :caption: Contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "   intro\n",
    "   quantum_mechanics\n",
    "~~~\n",
    ">For further information, see this [page](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the example above, if you want `Introduction` instead of `intro` and `Quantum mechanics` instead of `quantum_mechanics` to appear in the TOC, you can write:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    ".. toctree::\n",
    "   :maxdepth: 2\n",
    "   :caption: Contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Introduction <intro>\n",
    "   Quantum mechanics <quantum_mechanics>\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Alternatively, you can delete the file `index.rst` and replace it with your own notebook called `index.ipynb` which will serve as main page. In this case you can create the main toctree in `index.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Then you can read this [section](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.0/usage.html#Sphinx-Configuration-Values) to configure your `Sphinx` and this [section](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.0/usage.html#nbsphinx-Configuration-Values) to configure `nbsphinx`."

    "\n",
    "3. If you want to use the `sphinx_glpi_theme`, delete or comment out the line `html_theme = 'alabaster'` in `conf.py` and add the following lines:\n",

    "~~~python\n",
    "import sphinx_glpi_theme\n",

Sphinx Error. contents.rst not found` (as described in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56336234/build-fail-sphinx-error-contents-rst-not-found)) when building the website in https://readthedocs.org, add the following line to `conf.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "master_doc = 'index'\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Go to https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/ and click `Import a Project` to import your Github repo. Try to refresh it if you do not see your repo. Click the plus button to import. Then follow the instructions given there. \n",
    ">Remark: remember to push your commits that you made locally on your machine to Github! \n",
    "\n",
    "6. After successfully importing your repo, remember to click `Build` to build your website! Wait for a while to let the website be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. When it is built successfully, view the newly created website and check if everything is in order. Voila! You have created your first documentation website hosted using Read the docs!"
